3 Installation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Drop riak.js, json2.js, and a recent version of jQuery into a Riak bucket.

  2. Enjoy!

4 Running unit tests 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You'll need to have curl installed in order to set up the testing environment.

  0. If your Riak server is listening on something other than
     127.0.0.1:8098, you'll need to edit tests/setup to point to the
     right host and port. The variables to edit are called, helpfully,
     HOST and PORT.

  1. To install the test environment, run the setup script in the
     tests directory with the -i option:

   cd tests;./setup -i

  2. You can now run the unit tests by pointing your browser to the
     unit test page. Assuming Riak is listening on 127.0.0.1:8098, the
     URL for the unit tests is:
     [http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/basho_test/tests.html].

  3. You can clean out any transient test data by running the setup
     script with the -c option: cd tests;./setup -c

  4. Finally, you can remove the test environment by running setup
     again with the -u option:
    
   cd tests;./setup -u
